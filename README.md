# java_exercise
This repo is basically based on the exercises given in the book - The Java Programming Language, Ken Arnold, David Holmes, James Gosling, Prakash Goteti, 3rd Edition, PearsonÂ 

## Notes 
Going through the introduction and sumarry, below are my ramblings , session 1 - 10_11_2024

- JAVA Terminology
- Main features of JAVA

Java was created via Sun Microsystems in 1991 by James Gosling and Patrick Naughton.
It was later acquired by Oracle. It is an OOPs paradigm based language which supports readability , reusability and modularization. 

Write -> Compile -> Run 

Write in Java 
// Execution phase 
JAVAC is present in JDK , which compiles and converts to Bytecode - which makes a .class file.
JVM takes the Bytecode and provide the needed output by running the Bytecode.

Why is JAVA a platform independent language ? 
Because of JVM being available for download for MAC, Windows and Unix / Linux ( kernel ) , so Java programs can be executed in any platform. 

Components necessary for JAVA - 

	1. JDK ( java development kit ) - this includes JRE , Debugger and other tools related to JAVA ex - JavaDoc ( used for documenting code entities ). 
	2. JRE ( Java Runtime Environment ) - this includes JVM , browser plugins , applets support.
	3. JVM ( Java Virtual Machine ) - this is used to run the .class file ( bytecode after compilation )
